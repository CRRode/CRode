    <h1>Code Review </h1>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmPbhqQFWIU"> Code Review</a>
    <p>I perform a code review in a video for each artifact selected in my initial plan. In this code review, I analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements </p>

    <div id="Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering">
    <h1>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/CRRode/cs-499-Enhancement-One"> Github repoitory</a>
    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  </p>
    <p>I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. The skills this artifact showcase are skills in building collaborative environments by making comments and having a modular design that other programmers familiar with c++ and OpenGL can understand, add, and change the program. The artifact was improved by expanding more on the original design. I added to the design by turning the platform into a standing desk. I did this by adding legs to the platform and creating a floor that the desk is standing on.</p>
    <p>When enhancing this project, I learned even more on how important comments are in a code. Without comments I do not know if I would have been able to figure out what each part of the code did. Luckly, I had comments already in the code to help me understand what each piece of the code was doing. One challenge I faced was getting my legs into the right position. This takes time as you must take an educated guess on the correct x,y,z coordinates to get the legs and the floor in the correct position. Getting over this challenge required some guess and checking. I would change the coordinates and check to see if the shape was in the right spot or how much closer it was to the right spot. The camera movements that I already coded into the program helped a lot as I could get closer to the legs to make sure they were perfectly even.  </p>
    <b>CS-499 Course Outcomes Reached </b>
    <p>[CS-499-01] Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science.  </p>
    <I class="indented">I met this outcome through the comments, in code documentation of changes and a modular structure that any programmer can hop in and edit. I added inline comments where I had enhanced the code along with some other areas that were not commented. Also, I added the overall functionality of each code file in the header of each file.</I>
    <p>[CS-499-02] Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts</p>
    <i class="indented">I met this outcome through the code review where I talked about the code and the enhancement plan that was carried out. I also reached this by providing comments where the code was enhanced using the best computer science practices and a written narrative of the enhancement. Lastly, this project uses DLLs, headers and other resources developed by others, which demonstrates my ability to work with peer-created code. </i>
    <p>[CS-499-04]Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</p>
    <i class="indented">I met this outcome by meeting the enhancement criteria I set myself and the entire project's criteria. I also used the best computer science practices when making the project and enhancement. Additionally, I showed skills in using the OpenGL API along with the Visual Studios IDE and the C++ coding language by using those tools to add more to the program such as the legs and floor.</i>
