    <h1 style="color: green;" >Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    <p>I have been in the computer science program since June of 2020 which puts me at a little less than four years to complete my degree. Throughout my schooling at SNHU, I experienced many distinct aspects of computer science. The area of computer science that interested me the most was software development. As I approach the completion of my Computer Science degree here at SNHU and embark on my journey to become a software developer, I want to reflect on my skills, and strengths gained throughout my course work.   </p>
    <p>In CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle I gained skills in collaborating in a team environment and communicating with stakeholders. This class did not involve actual coding but instead taught me about the SDLC and how to work within a software development team. This class taught me about the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle and how to master the agile development process. In CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms, I strengthened my skills in data structures and algorithms. I gained skills by applying appropriate data structures for effectively organizing data given the requirements and constraints of various problems, implementing technically sound algorithms that accurately perform required functions, employing basic algorithms and common data structures in developing effective computer programs, and assessing foundational algorithms and data structures for their use in solving processing problems. Throughout the entire program I gained skills in software engineering. Specifically in CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, where I applied software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development life cycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. I also gained skills in databases throughout my time at SNHU. I worked with both SQL and Mongo databases. In DAD-220: Intro to Struct Database Env, I learned to create structured database environments that incorporate basic processing functionality and allow for data management, data manipulation, and data analysis with SQL. Additionally in CS-465: Full Stack Development I, I created a webpage that worked with a Mongo database. Lastly, I gained skills in security throughout this program as well. In CS 305: Software Security I learned about advanced security concepts and how to develop secure code that complies with security testing protocols. I also learned how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely in CS 305.   </p>
    <p>In this portfolio, I will use the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization final project as my artifact for all three of my Enhancements. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using the OpenGL API. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course. Throughout the three enhancements I will show my skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Before enhancing this artifact, I created a code review video that goes over the original artifact, analyzing the structure, documentation, variables, arithmetic operations, loops and branches, and defensive programming for areas of improvement. It also outlines several enhancements that were then implemented. After the code review is the project section where the three enhancements are. There are links to the code review video and original code in the code review section and links to the original and enhanced code in the project section. The links for the code will take you to my GitHub where the code is hosted. Each enhancement has a narrative with it that goes over the artifact and the enhancement that was done to the artifact. It also goes over the skills that I showcased with the artifact and its enhancements as well as the CS 499 course outcomes there were met and how they were met.   </p>

    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  </p>
    <p>I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. The skills this artifact showcase are skills in building collaborative environments by making comments and having a modular design that other programmers familiar with c++ and OpenGL can understand, add, and change the program. The artifact was improved by expanding more on the original design. I added to the design by turning the platform into a standing desk. I did this by adding legs to the platform and creating a floor that the desk is standing on.</p>
    <p>When enhancing this project, I learned even more on how important comments are in a code. Without comments I do not know if I would have been able to figure out what each part of the code did. Luckly, I had comments already in the code to help me understand what each piece of the code was doing. One challenge I faced was getting my legs into the right position. This takes time as you must take an educated guess on the correct x,y,z coordinates to get the legs and the floor in the correct position. Getting over this challenge required some guess and checking. I would change the coordinates and check to see if the shape was in the right spot or how much closer it was to the right spot. The camera movements that I already coded into the program helped a lot as I could get closer to the legs to make sure they were perfectly even.  </p>

    <h1 style="color: green;">Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/CRRode/cs-499-Enhancement-Two"> Github repoitory</a>
    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.   </p>
   
    <p>I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. This project shows skills and albitites in algorithms and data structures because There are many algorithms in the program that are creating the shapes. I improved this artifact by adding instancing algorithms. These algorithms are used to increase the program's performance by only sending the shape data to the GPU once and then rendering it multiple times. For example, before the enhancement, there were multiple of the same cylinders being rendered. Each cylinder was sending data to the GPU even though it was the same data. Now, the data is only sent once, and we get the same number of cylinders in the program with increased performance. This changes the time complexity (BigO), from O(n), where “n” is the number of cylinders being made, to O(1). Also, the code is more concise and easier to maintain since the rendering logic for all the cylinders is contained within a single loop. This reduces the repetitive code for each cylinder, making it easier to manage and less prone to errors. </p>
    
    <p>Below is a screenshot of the cylinder instancing algorithm for the legs of the desk. This image shows my skills in implementing algorithms that improve the time complexity, increasing program performance and reducing redundant code. This also shows my skills in creating easily readable code and proper documentation that adheres to computer science best practices. </p>
    <img src="instance alg.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">


    <p>Additionally, I added an FPS counter to the program. This displays the current FPS in the window while the program is running. An FPS counter is an effective way to tell how well the program is performing. I have provided screenshots of the FPS counter code below. </p>
   
    <p>Here is the screenshots showing the function created to calculate the frames per second as well as the code for displaying the FPS in the window.  </p>

    <img src="display fps.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">

    <p>While enhancing this artifact I learned how important algorithms can be and how much they can change a program. Adding the algorithm increased the program's performance by reducing the amount of data sent to the GPU. The instancing algorithms also decreased the amount of code in the source file. There was a lot of code deleted after adding the algorithm because they were not needed any more. If I used instancing algorithms when I originally made the code, there would have been a lot of time saved. Getting the algorithm running was a little bit of a challenge. There were errors in the code when I first added it but after a little research, I figured out the problem and the code ran as intended.   </p>

    <div id="Enhancement Three: Databases">
    <h1 style="color: green;">Enhancement Three: Databases</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/CRRode/cs-499-Enhancement-Three-code"> Github repoitory</a>
    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  </p>
    <p> I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. In this artifact I showcase skills and abilities in software development by creating quality code that includes readability, maintainability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices and coding standards. I also showcase skills in software architecture by using appropriate design patterns, and modularization. I showcase skills in documentation throughout the code with inline comments and with intent and decision for the overall functionality of each code file in the header. Lastly, I showcase skills in performance optimization by using algorithms to boost overall performance. In this enhancement I improved the artifact by creating a SQL database that has the code for my shapes stored in it. I did this by creating a database called “ShapeCode” and a table in the database called “Shapes.” This table has the shape ID, name, data, and then the shapes render data. The shape data is the data that is needed to be called into the source code and the shapes render data is the data that need to be called in the while loop that renders the shape. This allows for a more collaborative environment because anyone can recreate the shapes that I already made in my code and add them to theirs. The shapes stored in the Shapes table are the sphere, cylinder, plane, cube, and light cube. As more shapes are created this table can expand with a simple SQL insert command. Below you can see the sphere code that was queried and inserted into the source code.  </p>
    <p>Here is the Shape data being inserted into the source code with proper documentation of the modification.</p>

    <p>Here is the sphere shape render data being inserted into the while loop that renders the shapes with proper documentation of the modification. </p>
    <img src="shape render data.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 70%; height: auto;"> 

    <p> Additionally, I created another database called “ProgramFiles” on the same server that stores the programs files such as the CPPs and the header files along with the glad files and the glew32 DLL file that are required to run this code. This will allow for snapshots of the program to be made to add a level of security to the code. If the original program is ever lost, there will be a database backup. Also, if anyone ever wants to create a new OpenGL program these databases can be used to assist in making the programs because the code for the shapes can easily be queried and inserted into the code so that you do not have to spend time figuring out how to make the shape yourself.  </p>
    
    <p>Below is a screenshot of the “ProgramFiles” table being created and queried using the select * from ProgramFiles command while using best computer science practices.  </p>
    <img src="Program files.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">

    <img src="vs queried.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">
    <p>Throughout enhancing and modifying the artifact, I gained a deeper understanding of technical concepts and tools related to software development such as SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. I was a little rusty on SQL since it has been a little while since I last used it, but this enhancement was an effective way to improve my skills in using SQL. Since I have not used SQL in a while, it was challenging at first to get started with creating a new database and tables but with a little help from the internet I was able to figure out everything I needed to get the job done.  </p>
