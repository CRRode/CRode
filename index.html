    <h1>Code Review </h1>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmPbhqQFWIU"> Code Review</a>
    <p>I perform a code review in a video for each artifact selected in my initial plan. In this code review, I analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements </p>

    <div id="Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering">
    <h1>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/CRRode/cs-499-Enhancement-One"> Github repoitory</a>
    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  </p>
    <p>I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. The skills this artifact showcase are skills in building collaborative environments by making comments and having a modular design that other programmers familiar with c++ and OpenGL can understand, add, and change the program. The artifact was improved by expanding more on the original design. I added to the design by turning the platform into a standing desk. I did this by adding legs to the platform and creating a floor that the desk is standing on.</p>
    <p>When enhancing this project, I learned even more on how important comments are in a code. Without comments I do not know if I would have been able to figure out what each part of the code did. Luckly, I had comments already in the code to help me understand what each piece of the code was doing. One challenge I faced was getting my legs into the right position. This takes time as you must take an educated guess on the correct x,y,z coordinates to get the legs and the floor in the correct position. Getting over this challenge required some guess and checking. I would change the coordinates and check to see if the shape was in the right spot or how much closer it was to the right spot. The camera movements that I already coded into the program helped a lot as I could get closer to the legs to make sure they were perfectly even.  </p>

    <div id="Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure">
    <h1>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/CRRode/cs-499-Enhancement-Two"> Github repoitory</a>
    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.   </p>
    <p>I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. This project shows skills and albitites in algorithms and data structures because There are many algorithms in the program that are creating the shapes. I improved this artifact by adding instancing algorithms. These algorithms are used to increase the program's performance by only sending the shape data to the GPU once and then rendering it multiple times. For example, before the enhancement, there were multiple of the same cylinders being rendered. Each cylinder was sending data to the GPU even though it was the same data. Now, the data is only sent once, and we get the same number of cylinders in the program with increased performance. This changes the time complexity (BigO), from O(n), where “n” is the number of cylinders being made, to O(1). Also, the code is more concise and easier to maintain since the rendering logic for all the cylinders is contained within a single loop. This reduces the repetitive code for each cylinder, making it easier to manage and less prone to errors. Additionally, I added an FPS counter to the program. This displays the current FPS in the window while the program is running. An FPS counter is an effective way to tell how well the program is performing.   </p>
    <p>While enhancing this artifact I learned how important algorithms can be and how much they can change a program. Adding the algorithm increased the program's performance by reducing the amount of data sent to the GPU. The instancing algorithms also decreased the amount of code in the source file. There was a lot of code deleted after adding the algorithm because they were not needed any more. If I used instancing algorithms when I originally made the code, there would have been a lot of time saved. Getting the algorithm running was a little bit of a challenge. There were errors in the code when I first added it but after a little research, I figured out the problem and the code ran as intended.   </p>
