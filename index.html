    <h1>Code Review </h1>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmPbhqQFWIU"> Code Review</a>
    <p>I perform a code review in a video for each artifact selected in my initial plan. In this code review, I analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements </p>

    <h1>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/CRRode/cs-499-Enhancement-One"> Github repoitory</a>
    <p>The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  </p>
    <p>I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. The skills this artifact showcase are skills in building collaborative environments by making comments and having a modular design that other programmers familiar with c++ and OpenGL can understand, add, and change the program. The artifact was improved by expanding more on the original design. I added to the design by turning the platform into a standing desk. I did this by adding legs to the platform and creating a floor that the desk is standing on.</p>
    <b>CS-499 Course Outcomes Reached </b>
    <p>employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science.  </p>
    <I>I met this outcome through the comments, in code documentation of changes and a modular structure that any programmer can hop in and edit. I added inline comments where I had enhanced the code along with some other areas that were not commented. Also, I added the overall functionality of each code file in the header of each file.</I>
