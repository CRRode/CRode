Professional Self-Assessment

I have been in the computer science program since June 2020, which puts me at a little less than four years remaining to complete my degree. Throughout my schooling at SNHU, I experienced many distinct aspects of computer science. The area of computer science that interested me the most was software development. As I approach the completion of my Computer Science degree here at SNHU and embark on my journey to become a software developer, I want to reflect on my skills and strengths gained throughout my coursework.

In CS-250: Software Development Life Cycle, I gained skills in collaborating in a team environment and communicating with stakeholders. This class did not involve actual coding but instead taught me about the SDLC and how to work within a software development team. It taught me about the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle and how to master the Agile development process. In CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms, I strengthened my skills in data structures and algorithms. I gained skills by applying appropriate data structures for effectively organizing data given the requirements and constraints of various problems, implementing technically sound algorithms that accurately perform required functions, employing basic algorithms and common data structures in developing effective computer programs, and assessing foundational algorithms and data structures for their use in problem-solving. Throughout the program, I gained skills in software engineering. Specifically in CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, where I applied software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development life cycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. I also gained skills in databases throughout my time at SNHU. In DAD-220: Intro to Structured Database Environments, I learned to create structured database environments that incorporate basic processing functionality and allow for data management, data manipulation, and data analysis with SQL. Additionally, in CS-465: Full Stack Development, I created a webpage that worked with a Mongo database. Lastly, I gained skills in security throughout this program as well. In CS 305: Software Security, I learned about advanced security concepts and how to develop secure code that complies with security testing protocols. I also learned how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely in CS 305.

In this portfolio, I will use the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization final project as my artifact for all three of my enhancements. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using the OpenGL API. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course. Throughout the three enhancements, I will show my skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Before enhancing this artifact, I created a code review video that goes over the original artifact, analyzing the structure, documentation, variables, arithmetic operations, loops and branches, and defensive programming for areas of improvement. It also outlines several enhancements that were then implemented. After the code review is the project section where the three enhancements are. There are links to the code review video and original code in the code review section and links to the original and enhanced code in the project section. The links for the code will take you to my GitHub where the code is hosted. Each enhancement has a narrative with it that goes over the artifact and the enhancement that was done to the artifact. It also goes over the skills that I showcased with the artifact and its enhancements as well as the CS 499 course outcomes that were met and how they were met.


Code Review

I perform a code review in a video for each artifact selected in my initial plan. In this code review, I analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements

PROJECTS

Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.

I chose this artifact because it represents one of the most complex programs I developed during my time at SNHU. Recognizing its complexity, I identified numerous areas for enhancement. This artifact exemplifies my ability to create collaborative environments through proper commenting and a modular design approach. Such practices ensure that fellow programmers, particularly those acquainted with C++ and OpenGL, can readily comprehend, contribute to, and modify the program. In enhancing this artifact, I expanded upon its original design by introducing innovative elements. One significant addition was transforming the platform into a standing desk. This involved integrating legs to support the platform and adding a floor upon which the desk stands. These enhancements not only augment the program's functionality but also demonstrate my capacity for creative problem-solving and ingenuity in design.

When enhancing this project, I learned even more about how important comments are in code. Without comments, I don't know if I would have been able to figure out what each part of the code did. Luckily, I had comments already in the code to help me understand what each piece of the code was doing. One challenge I faced was getting my legs into the right position. This takes time as you must make an educated guess on the correct x, y, z coordinates to get the legs and the floor in the correct position. Getting over this challenge required some guess and check. I would change the coordinates and check to see if the shape was in the right spot or how much closer it was to the right spot. The camera movements that I already coded into the program helped a lot as I could get closer to the legs to make sure they were perfectly even.

Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in utilizing the OpenGL API, Visual Studio IDE, and the C++ coding language. These skills were showcased through the incorporation of additional features into the program, such as the implementation of legs and a floor.

Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.

I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be done to this project. This project shows skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures because there are many algorithms in the program that are creating the shapes. I improved this artifact by optimizing it with instancing algorithms. These algorithms are used to increase the program's performance by only sending the shape data to the GPU once and then rendering it multiple times. For example, before the enhancement, there were multiple instances of the same cylinders being rendered. Each cylinder was sending data to the GPU even though it was the same data. Now, the data is only sent once, and we get the same number of cylinders in the program with increased performance. This changes the time complexity (Big O) from O(n), where 'n' is the number of cylinders being made, to O(1). Also, the code is more concise and easier to maintain since the rendering logic for all the cylinders is contained within a single loop. This reduces the repetitive code for each cylinder, making it easier to manage and less prone to errors.

Additionally, I added an FPS counter to the program. This displays the current FPS in the window while the program is running. An FPS counter is an effective way to tell how well the program is performing. I have provided screenshots of the FPS counter code below.

While enhancing this artifact, I learned how important algorithms can be and how much they can change a program. Adding the algorithm increased the program's performance by reducing the amount of data sent to the GPU. The instancing algorithms also decreased the amount of code in the source file. There was a lot of code deleted after adding the algorithm because it was not needed anymore. If I used instancing algorithms when I originally made the code, there would have been a lot of time saved. Getting the algorithm running was a little bit of a challenge. There were errors in the code when I first added it but after a little research, I figured out the problem and the code ran as intended.

Enhancement Three: Databases

The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.

I selected this artifact because it was one of the more complex programs that I made during my time at SNHU, and I knew there were many enhancements that could be made to this project. I showcase skills and abilities in software development by creating quality code that includes readability, maintainability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices and coding standards. Additionally, I demonstrate skills in software architecture by using appropriate design patterns and modularization. Throughout the code, I provide documentation with inline comments and clear descriptions of the overall functionality of each code file in the header. Lastly, I demonstrate skills in performance optimization by using algorithms to boost overall performance. In this enhancement, I improved the artifact by creating a SQL database that stores the code for my shapes. I accomplished this by creating a database called 'ShapeCode' and a table within it called 'Shapes.' The 'Shapes' table includes fields for shape ID, name, data, and rendering data. The shape data is the information needed to be called into the source code, while the shapes render data is the information required in the while loop that renders the shape. This allows for a more collaborative environment because anyone can recreate the shapes that I already made in my code and add them to theirs. The shapes stored in the 'Shapes' table include the sphere, cylinder, plane, cube, and light cube. As more shapes are created, this table can expand with a simple SQL insert command. Below, you can see the sphere code that was queried and inserted into the source code.


Additionally, I created another database called 'ProgramFiles' on the same server to store the program's files, such as the CPPs and header files, along with the 'glad' files and the 'glew32' DLL file required to run this code. This setup allows for snapshots of the program to be taken, adding a layer of security to the code. In the event that the original program is lost, there will be a database backup available. Furthermore, if anyone wishes to create a new OpenGL program, these databases can be utilized to facilitate the process. The code for the shapes can be easily queried and inserted into the program, saving time and effort in figuring out how to create the shapes from scratch.


Throughout the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact, I deepened my understanding of technical concepts and tools related to software development, such as SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. While I was a bit rusty on SQL due to not having used it for some time, this enhancement provided an effective opportunity to sharpen my SQL skills. Initially, it was challenging to get started with creating a new database and tables, given my lack of recent experience with SQL. However, with some assistance from online resources, I was able to overcome these challenges and complete the task successfully.
